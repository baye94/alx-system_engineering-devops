# 0x06. Regular expression
``Regex`` ``DevOps``

In the project I learnt to build regular expressions using Oniguruma, a regular expression library which is used by Ruby by default. 

## TASKS
<i>Note: Each Ruby script in the project matches regular expressions based on an argument passed to it via the command line</i>

- Task 0
    - [0-simply_match_school.rb](https://github.com/BrightTech10/alx-system_engineering-devops/blob/main/0x06-regular_expressions/0-simply_match_school.rb): The regular expression must match ``School``

- Task 1
    - [1-repetition_token_0.rb](https://github.com/BrightTech10/alx-system_engineering-devops/blob/main/0x06-regular_expressions/1-repetition_token_0.rb): Ruby script that matches the regular expression ``hbn`` with between 2-5 ``t``'s in between ``hb`` and ``n``.

- Task 2
    - [2-repetition_token_1.rb](https://github.com/BrightTech10/alx-system_engineering-devops/blob/main/0x06-regular_expressions/2-repetition_token_1.rb): Ruby script that matches the regular expression ``hn`` with 0 or 1 occurrences of ``b`` and 0 or 1 occurrences of ``t`` in between ``h`` and ``n``.

- Task 3
    - [3-repetition_token_2.rb](https://github.com/BrightTech10/alx-system_engineering-devops/blob/main/0x06-regular_expressions/3-repetition_token_2.rb): Ruby script that matches the regular expression ``hbn`` with 1 or more ``t``'s in between ``hb`` and ``n``.

- Task 4
    - [4-repetition_token_3.rb](https://github.com/BrightTech10/alx-system_engineering-devops/blob/main/0x06-regular_expressions/4-repetition_token_3.rb): Ruby script that matches the regular expression ``hbn`` with 0 or more ``t``'s in between ``hb`` and ``n``.

- Task 5
    - [5-beginning_and_end.rb](https://github.com/BrightTech10/alx-system_engineering-devops/blob/main/0x06-regular_expressions/5-beginning_and_end.rb): Ruby script that matches a regular expression starting with ``h`` and ending with ``n`` with any single character in between.

- Task 6
    - [6-phone_number.rb](https://github.com/BrightTech10/alx-system_engineering-devops/blob/main/0x06-regular_expressions/6-phone_number.rb): Ruby script that matches a regular expression representing a 10-digit phone number.

- Task 7
    - [7-OMG_WHY_ARE_YOU_SHOUTING.rb](https://github.com/BrightTech10/alx-system_engineering-devops/blob/main/0x06-regular_expressions/7-OMG_WHY_ARE_YOU_SHOUTING.rb): Ruby script that matches regular expressions of uppercase letters.

- Task 8
    - [100-textme.rb](https://github.com/BrightTech10/alx-system_engineering-devops/blob/main/0x06-regular_expressions/100-textme.rb): Ruby script that runs statistics on TextMe app text message transcations.
    - Output: ``[SENDER],[RECEIVER],[FLAGS]`` where
        - ``[SENDER]`` is the sender phone number or name (including country code if present).
        - ``[RECEIVER]`` is the receiver phone number or name (including country code if present).
        - ``[FLAGS]`` is the flags that were used.
