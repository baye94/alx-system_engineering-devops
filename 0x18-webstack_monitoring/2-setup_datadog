# 0x18. Webstack Monitoring

## Description

This project is part of the ALX System Engineering & DevOps track. It focuses on setting up infrastructure monitoring using [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/), a cloud-based monitoring and analytics platform for IT operations and development teams.

## Objectives

- Learn how to install the Datadog agent on a server
- Set up application and API keys
- Connect a remote web server to the Datadog dashboard
- Monitor server metrics and events in real time
- Validate monitoring setup using Datadog's API

## Steps Taken

1. **Datadog Account Creation**
   - Signed up for a free Datadog account at https://www.datadoghq.com
   - Selected the **US1 region** for setup

2. **Agent Installation**
   - SSHed into the remote server `web-01`
   - Installed the Datadog agent using the installation script:
     ```bash
     DD_AGENT_MAJOR_VERSION=7 DD_API_KEY=<my_api_key> DD_SITE="datadoghq.com" bash -c "$(curl -L https://s3.amazonaws.com/dd-agent/scripts/install_script.sh)"
     ```

3. **Hostname Configuration**
   - Updated the hostname of the server to match project naming convention:
     ```bash
     sudo hostnamectl set-hostname XX-web-01
     sudo systemctl restart datadog-agent
     ```

4. **API and Application Keys**
   - Created a Datadog Application Key from the [API settings page](https://app.datadoghq.com/account/settings#api)
   - Submitted both the **API key** and **App key** on my Intranet profile

5. **Verification**
   - Confirmed that the server `XX-web-01` appears in Datadogâ€™s infrastructure dashboard
   - Also validated presence using Datadog API:
     ```bash
     curl -X GET "https://api.datadoghq.com/api/v1/hosts" \
     -H "DD-API-KEY: <my_api_key>" \
     -H "DD-APPLICATION-KEY: <my_app_key>"
     ```
