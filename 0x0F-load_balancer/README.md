0x0F Load balancer 🔧

Using a shell script is most useful for repetitive tasks that may be time consuming to execute by typing one line at a time. A few examples of applications shell scripts can be used for include: Automating the code compiling process. Running a program or creating a program environment. This project covers the load balancer configuration for DevOps development
At the end of this project, I was able to solve these questions:

Improve a web stack so that there is redundancy for our web servers.
Accept more traffic by doubling the number of web servers.
Make a infrastructure more reliable.
Tasks ✔️

Bash script that configure Nginx so that its HTTP response contains a custom header (on web-01 and web-02)
Bash script that install and configure HAproxy on your lb-01 server.
Automating the task of creating a custom HTTP header response, but with Puppet based on script 0
